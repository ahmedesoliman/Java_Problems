You are given an array segments consisting of N integers denoting the lengths of several segments. 
Your task is to find among them four segments from which a rectangle can be constructed. 
What is the minimum absolute difference between the side lengths of the constructed rectangle? 

Write a function: int solution(int] segments); that, given an array segments, returns the minimum absolute difference between the side lengths of the constructed rectangle 
or −1 if no rectangle can be constructed. 


Examples: 

1. For segments =[2,2,2,2,2], we can construct only a 2×2 rectangle out of the given segments. The function should return 0 . 

2. For segments =[911,1,3,1000,1000,2,2,999,1000,911], we can construct three rectangles:
2x911,2×1000, and 911×1000. Out of those three possibilities, the best one is 911×1000. 
The function should return 89. 

3. For segments =[4,1,1,1,3], we cannot construct any rectangle out of the gifen segments. The function should return −1

4. For segments =[1,1,1], we cannot construct any rectangle out of the given segments. The function should return −1. 

Assume that: 

N is an integer within the range [1.30]: - each element of array segments is an integer within the range [1.1,000].
